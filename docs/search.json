    "text": "The Sangre de Cristo Mountains in southern Colorado record a spectacular multiphase deformation history encompassing every major period of tectonism in the Rocky Mountain region. This includes Ancestral Rocky Mountain deformation and sedimentation (~320 to 270 Ma), Laramide folding and thrusting (~80 to 55 Ma), and most recent Rio Grande Rift associated extension (~30 Ma to present) and related magmatism.\nAs part of my M.S. research, I’ve focused on detailed geologic mapping (1:10,000), geochronology, and kinematic analysis of the Deadman Creek Thrust, an area just north of Great Sand Dunes National Park in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. This feature is a Laramide-age shallowly west-dipping zone of deformation on the western flank of the Sangres.\n\n\n\nView of the Sand Dunes from my field area in the Sangres\n\n\nBased on our preliminary mapping and analysis, we’ve found that the sheared rocks in this zone record both top to the NE shear (Laramide thrusting) and later top to the SW shear (Rio Grande Rift extension). We’ve also found additional Rio Grande Rift-associated normal faults that dissect the range as well as Oligocene gabbroic intrusions. These intrusions likely raised the geothermal gradient enough to cause high-temperature mylonites to form as unusually low depths (~7km beneath the surface).\nWith my advisor, John Singleton, our in-progress geologic map and analysis of the deformation in the Deadman Creek Thrust expose the ways in which Rio Grande Rift extension has overprinted older geologic structures of Ancestral Rocky Mountain and Laramide deformation and provides context for a larger conversation about the geologic history of Colorado. Stay tuned for my completed map and publication!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lower Colorado River region of Arizona and California contains generally conspicuous fluvial sediments lining the valleys of the Colorado River and several of its tributaries. These deposits consist of mud, sand, and gravel representative of floodplain and channel environments and locally interfingering with alluvial fans emanating from surrounding mountain ranges. Together they record the history of aggradation and incision of the Colorado River during Pleistocene time.\nAs an NAGT intern at USGS, I assisted research geologists Adam Hudson and Harrison Gray to better constrain the depositional history recorded by these fluvial sedimentary units using U-Th carbonate and luminescence geochronology. From the age data, we can make inferences about past drivers of the evolution of the Colorado River.\nClick here to learn more about this project.\n\n\n\nCamping at Lake Mohave during my time as an NAGT intern"

I’m using geologic field mapping, geochronology, and microtectonics to solve geologic problems. I am working towards advancing my expertise in ArcGIS, computer science/coding, laboratory instrumentation, and science communication."

    "text": "I was born and raised in Denver and consider the Front Range of Colorado my home. As a kid, I spent copious time painting, drawing, and otherwise exploring visual art and participated in my high school’s swim team.\nI spent my college years exploring the geology of the eastern Washington at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. Taking advantage of the liberal arts education model, I double majored in Geology and German Studies and studied abroad at IES Freiburg in Germany. I completed Indiana University's Geology Field Camp in Summer of 2021. During this time I became interested in geologic field mapping and structural geology of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n\n\nField Camp mapping project in the Sawtooth Mountains, ID\n\n\nIn the year after college, I worked at Broadbent & Associates, Inc - an environmental consulting firm - as a field geologist on groundwater remediation projects in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and New Mexico. Following this, I was lucky enough to work as an NAGT intern at USGS in Lakewood, CO. There, I discovered my interests in isotope geochemistry and geochronology to solve geologic problems.\nIn 2023 I started my M.S. degree at Colorado State University, hoping to pursue interests in geologic field mapping, structural geology, and geochronology. My thesis project is located in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Southern Colorado (just north of Great Sand Dunes National Park), where I’m exploring the kinematics and timing of deformation in the Deadman Shear Zone. Please visit the research page to find out more about the things I have worked on.\n\n\nI enjoy taking road trips to national parks,\n \nparticipating in triathlons,\n\nand showshoeing in the winter.\n\nI enjoy finding colorful flora and foliage wherever I go!"
